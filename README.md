# 2048-Game-Cpp
This is an implementation of the classic 2048 game using C++.

This is the first C++ project I have build myself from scratch. The idea to make this project came after watching this vedio by Parikh Jain(https://www.linkedin.com/in/parikh-jain-79568798/) Sir.

At first I was trying to implement the compress and merge function using a single loop.
But was unable to firgure out a logic do so.
Then I tried to implement the compress and merge function using nested if-else and thus code what to do for each possibilty.
Suppperrr lengthy processs!!! But the very basic idea.

Then I refered to this article on gfg contributed by Amit Mangal(https://www.linkedin.com/in/amit-mangal/) sir.
